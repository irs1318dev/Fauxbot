# Fauxbot

Fauxbot is a simple simulation environment used for teaching lessons in Robot programming.

## Getting Started
In order to get started with Fauxbot, you should first follow the [steps in Robot Programming Guide](/Robot%20Programming%20Guide.md#setting-up-your-environment).

If you are using Eclipse, note that for Fauxbot you will also need to install the e(fx)clipse plugin in order to work with JavaFX.  To do so, go to Help --> Install New Software..., then select to work with "--All Available Sites--", filter for "e(fx)clipse", and select the e(fx)clipse plugin.  Follow the wizard and restart Eclipse when you are done.

## Exercises
There are currently 2 main Fauxbot exercises, GarageDoor and Elevator.  In order to start working on one, please switch branches to the corresponding branch (GarageDoorExercise or ElevatorExercise).
