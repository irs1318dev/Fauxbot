The Issaquah Robotics Societyâ€™s Robot code is designed to be a good example of a moderately large software project that students of varying levels of experience with programming can contribute to.  It is aimed at making the programming of the robot easy, so that it can respond well to changes to the physical robot as well as changes in the way that we wish to control the robot.  It achieves this by encapsulating each part in a different area of the code, with the idea that there should be very little duplication of code to ease maintainability.
