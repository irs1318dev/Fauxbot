# ControlTasks

Tasks are used to control operations or groups of operations that run until a certain condition is met.  They are used within Macros and Autonomous Routines and can be composed together to perform complex actions.  Tasks themselves should aim to be relatively simple and only accomplish on thing if possible - this helps prevent code duplication later.  An example of a single task is "DriveDistanceTask", which drives forward for a specified distance.

Tasks implement the ```IControlTask``` interface, and typically extend from the ```ControlTaskBase``` class.  Tasks work by applying certain values to one or more operations.  When the task first starts, the ```begin()``` function is called so that the task can check the current state of the robot.  Every ~20ms, the ```update()``` function is called to update the settings based on the criteria defined in the task.  Before running ```update()```, the ```hasCompleted()``` function is called to check whether the task should end.  There are also functions such as ```shouldCancel()``` to indicate that the task needs to end even though it hasn't officially completed, ```end()``` to do clean-up after the task has completed, and ```stop()``` to do clean-up if the task was cancelled.
