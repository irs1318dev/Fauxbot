# Autonomous Routines

Autonomous routines are designed very similarly to macros, except that they are triggered automatically by the Driver when the autonomous mode starts instead of by buttons on the joystick.  Autonomous routine selection occurs in the ```AutonomousRoutineSelector``` class, with the specific routines defined in that class as well.
