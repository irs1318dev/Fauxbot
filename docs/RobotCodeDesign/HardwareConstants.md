# HardwareConstants

Similar to the ```ElectronicsConstants``` and ```TuningConstants```, we also store some facts about the dimensions of the robot and the different parts of the robot as constants in the ```HardwareConstants``` class.  This tends to include things like the diameter of the wheels and the width of the robot, which may be useful for calculations that need to be made during autonomous mode or for determining the robot's position and orientation on the field.
