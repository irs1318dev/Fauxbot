# Shifts

Sometimes there aren't enough buttons on the joystick in order to accomodate the number of operations and macros that we want to have available to the driver and/or codriver.  We have the ability to define "shifts" that allow the same button to mean different things depending on when another button is pressed.  These shifts are described in the ```ButtonMap```.
