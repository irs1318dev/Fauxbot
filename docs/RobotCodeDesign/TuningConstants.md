# TuningConstants

In order to simplify tuning the settings of the robot, we store any "magic numbers" that we will likely want to change as constants in the ```TuningConstants``` class.  Settings that may need to be tuned include things like the speed at which to run an intake, or the speed at which to turn when the joystick is in a certain position.  These settings are usually things that are hard to know in advance, and the appropriate settings are discovered by testing the robot.  There are many things that arenâ€™t known in advance by the software team, so putting all of these things in ```TuningConstants``` in an organized fashion can help speed up the tuning process of the robot and prevent bugs.
