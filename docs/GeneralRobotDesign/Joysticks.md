# Joysticks

The joystick is a normal computer joystick, much like you’d find for playing a flight simulator game.  The ones that we have used for the past few years is the Logitech Xtreme 3D Pro, which has 12 buttons, the primary X and Y axis, a Throttle axis, and a directional hat.  Our team historically used a single joystick as the Driver’s primary input metho,d through 2019.
