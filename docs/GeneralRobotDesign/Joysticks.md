# Joysticks

The joystick is a normal computer joystick, much like you’d find for playing a flight simulator game.  In the past we have used the Logitech Xtreme 3D Pro, which has 12 buttons, the primary X and Y axis, a Throttle axis, and a directional hat.  Before 2020, our team typically used a single joystick as the Driver’s primary input method.
