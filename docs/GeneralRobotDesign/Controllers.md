# Controllers

A common controller type in FRC is an Xbox 360, Xbox One, PS4 controller, or a 3rd-party controller that has USB input.  Sometimes these controllers are called "gamepads".  Since 2020, we have switched to typically having a Driver and Codriver each with their own controller to work together to perform tasks.
