# Controllers

Another controller type is an Xbox 360, Xbox One, PS4 controller, or a 3rd-party controller that has USB input.  This is an alternative that can be used by a Driver and/or Codriver of the robot if the control scheme is preferable based on that year's challenge.  Since 2020, we have switched to typically having a Driver and Codriver each with their own controller to work together to perform tasks.
