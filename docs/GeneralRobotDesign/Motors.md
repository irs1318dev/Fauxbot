# Motors

Electric motors are typically used to provide movement for the robot.  They provide a rotational force that is dependent on the current setting on them and the amount of voltage that is available.  Motors are useful when a certain amount of motion is needed or when there are motions that need to happen at different speeds (as opposed to all-or-nothing).  Motors are used in places such as drive trains, elevators, and intakes.  In WPILib, they are controlled using a double value (rational number) between -1.0 and 1.0.  Since 2018, we have typically used the Talon SRX which can incorporate the abilities of a motor, an encoder, a top/bottom limit switch, and a PID controller to allow for advanced control.  In 2020, we started using brushless motors, including the Falcon with its built-in TalonFX motor controller as well as the NEO with its corresponding Spark MAX motor controller.
