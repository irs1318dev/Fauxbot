# Pneumatics

Pneumatic cylinders are also used to provide movement for components on the robot.  They provide a linear force and are controlled very simply by a set of 2 valves (solenoids) that change where air pressure is directed in order to move the rod within the cylinder.  There are 3 settings: "off" which means that no air pressure is applied through either valve, "forward" which means that air pressure is applied through one valve, and "reverse" which means that air pressure is applied through the other valve.  Forward and Reverse typically correlates to whether the piston is actively pushing out or actively pulling in, but it depends on how the pneumatics are set up.  Due to the way that they work, pneumatics controlled by solenoids trigger all-or-nothing movements.  Solenoids are often used in "shooters" such as the kicker on the 2016 robot, or for controlling the position of an intake such as on the 2019 robot.  In WPILib, they are controlled using settings of Value.kOff, Value.kForward, and Value.kReverse.
