# Limit Switches

Limit switches are simple switches that are used to sense when two things are physically touching.  They are simple electronic devices that complete a circuit (or break a circuit) when the switch is pressed, and break a circuit (or complete it) when released.  In WPILib, you would use a DigitalInput, which returns a true or false based on whether the limit switch is pressed or not.
