# Dip Switches

Dip Switches are simple toggle switches which are used to switch between different modes on the Robot.  Our team historically used dip switches to allow us to select which of several different pre-programmed autonomous routines to use without having to change anything within the code or rely on the smart dashboard.  In 2019, we started using the Smart Dashboard to choose the autonomous routine.
