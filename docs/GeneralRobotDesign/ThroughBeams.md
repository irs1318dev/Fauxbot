# Through-beam Sensors

Through-Beam Sensors are simple infrared sensors and lights that are used to sense whether there is anything between the light and sensor.  They are often used in the real world at the bottom of a garage door to detect if anything is under the garage door so it doesnâ€™t get crushed.  This can be used on a robot to sense whether something is in a given location.  We often use them on robots to detect whether the game piece has been successfully picked up.  In WPILib, you would use an AnalogInput, which returns a double value (rational number) which indicates how many volts were detected by the infrared sensor.  This value will differ based on the through-beam sensor, so you can tell through experimentation whether it is tripped or not for a given value range.
