# Encoders

Encoders are used to measure the amount that an axle has rotated.  There are different types of encoders (optical, magnetic).  We typically use a quadrature encoder, which can detect the amount of rotation and the direction in which the axle has rotated.  Each encoder has a rating for how many "pulses" or ticks it receives in a complete rotation of the axle.  Using some simple math based on the sizes of the wheels (and gears), you can calculate how far something has travelled.  In WPILib, you would typically use an Encoder object, which returns the number of ticks/pulses, the distance (based on the distance per pulse), or the velocity (if you trust the timer on the robot).  In some scenarios, such as when using a TalonSRX, TalonFX, or SparkMAX motor controller, the encoder plugs into the motor controller and is instead used as a part of controlling the motor.  In other scenarios, such as some absolute encoders, the sensor is actually an Analog sensor.  For such encoders, WPILib would use an AnalogInput, which returns a double (rational number) value between 0V (0 degrees) and 5V (360 degrees).
