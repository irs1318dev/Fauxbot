This is used to prevent bouncing between the detected and undetected states for objects on the threshold. If the threshold is set to 0.1 meters, and the hysteresis is 0.01 meters, then an object needs to be within 0.09 meters to be detected. After the object is first detected, the distance then needs to exceed 0.11 meters to become undetected again. 0-1m, default 0.01m
     * @param minSignalStrengthForValidMeasurement The minimum allowable signal strength before determining the measurement is valid. If the signal strength is particularly low, this typically means the object is far away and there's fewer total samples to derive the distance from. Set this value to be below the lowest strength you see when you're detecting an object with the CANrange; the default of 2500 is typically acceptable in most cases. 1-15000, default 2500.
